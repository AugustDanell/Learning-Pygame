# Python-Games
This folder contains games that I am either currently working on or that I am done with. Most of the games are written in Python using the library Pygame, as the name of the repo suggests. However, some games might also be in other languages, or using other libraries and frameworks than that of Pygame. Overall I 

All the games that I am done with I aim to present a short demo with on Youtube, and for every such demo there will also be a link back to this Git Hub code. As such it is a structure like that of a double linked list, or something of the sort, where one can access the demo from git, but one can also access git from the youtube demo. Here follows a list of the games written so far:

- Belgrade 1456 (Still in progress): An action game where the player is playing as one of the defenders of the city of Belgrade in the historic battle that took place there in 1456. The player plays as a knight, being able to use both sword and pistol, traversing down the different levels. Currently I am working on implementing a way of saving and loading games. Like with much of my other games the animations are not very good but it is more so to learn the coding progress of writing games I am doing this. 

- Bridge Guarder: A game that I made within an hour, it is sloppy made and abandoned because the gameplay is not fun at all. The game is based on a situation where there were cows let loose and they walked over a bridge crossing. The game is about saving as many cows and boats as possible, when the bridge is folded upwards the boats can go under and when its folded downwards the cows can cross. 

- Flappy Nacka Bird (in folder plattformer): This game is a python implementation of the classical game Flappy Bird but the bird in this game is a bird that I took a picture of while I was out in nature, in the forest in Nacka. It uses the same mechanics as that of the normal flappy bird game:

- MonopolClone (Still in progress): This is a game in Java, though I am porting it over to Python so that I can work with Pygame, a library that is much more suited to write games with than the graphical library I have been using in Java. The idea is to make an online board game with similar mechanics to that of Monopoly though this version is taking place in the city of Norrtälje. We implement this using a communication protocol between a server and client(s) using sockets, where the bulk of the logic is placed on the server side and certain commandos from the clients, what they roll with the dice, what square they bought etc, is passed over to the server. The shuffling algorithm for shuffling cards is done with a fisher-yates algorithm that can be found in the algorithms folder.

- Cossacks (In folder gameProgramming): An implementation of the game of space invaders only here there are cossacks coming towards the player, and the player is playing as a defender of the city of Norrtälje. Historically this city was sacked by cossacks, and this game is inspired by that historical incident. The game is played just like space invaders that is the player is moving a cannon around and can shoot at the enemy:
