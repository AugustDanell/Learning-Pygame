''' Belgrade 1456
    This game is a little bit larger than many of the other games and an ongoing project as of 07-02. The game is of the

# A function that updates the enemyList and the removeList. Specifically, if an enemy is killed, for instance an enemy
# with id = 2, when there are 4 enemies with these ids: [1,2,3,4]. What should happen then is that id 3 and id 4 resp
# should be decremented so that the list [1,2,3,4] -> [1,2,3], after enemy with id 2 is removed. This function takes care
# of that update. This is done in two steps:
# 1. First the ids are updated in 'enemyList'
# 2. Second, the enemies in the list 'removeList' are popped from 'enemyList'. As per the example above, if an enemy with
# id = 2 is killed, removeList = [2], enemyList becomes updated as [1,2,2,3], and then removeList is iterated removing one of
# the instances of '2' so that we get [1,2,3] after killing an enemy (independantly of what ID the enemy holds).
